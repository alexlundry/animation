## Test of Github Pages
### Using Animation Demo HTML Output

This is a test of the Github Pages functionality.  

You can use Github Markdown in order to format this Read Me file.  You can add *italic text* or **bold text** - in fact it would appear to be identical to R Markdown syntax.  

Once you have pushed an HTML file into this repository, so long as Github Pages are enabled, you can find that file at the following address:

> https://<username>.github.io/<repo_name>/<name_of_html_file>.html

So, as both test and example, we should be able to find the Animation Demo, [here](https://alexlundry.github.io/animation/animation.html).

Or maybe here: [](https://alexlundry.github.io/animation/animation.html)
