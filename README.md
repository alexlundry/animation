## Test of Github Pages
### Using Animation Demo HTML Output

This is a test of the Github Pages functionality.  

You can use Github Markdown in order to format this Read Me file.  You can add *italic text* or **bold text** - in fact it would appear to be identical to R Markdown syntax.  

Once you have pushed an HTML file into this repository, so long as Github Pages are enabled, you can find that file at the following address:

> https://<username>.github.io/<repo_name>/<name_of_html_file>.html

So, as both test and example, we should be able to find the Animation Demo, [here](https://alexlundry.github.io/animation/animation.html).

The implication of all of this for YOU is that you can use this method to publish your final project online.  You can create interactive graphics in an R notebook or markdown file, then knit it as an HTML document, and push it into a Github repository that has Github Pages enabled.  You know have an online interactive project.
